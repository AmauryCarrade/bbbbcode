# bbbbcode

A flarum extension which adds additional bbcodes to Flarum. Overtime, more bbcodes will be added.

## Install

`composer require zerosonesfun/bbbbcode`

## Update

`composer update zerosonesfun/bbbbcode`

If that doesn't work, sometimes I find that completely removing the extension, and re-installing it works better. Also, you may need to uncheck, then re-check the box for this extension in your admin.

## Uninstall

`composer remove zerosonesfun/bbbbcode`

## Usage

Currently, here are the bbcodes which are added:

Tooltip: `[tooltip="your tip here"]word[/tooltip]`
